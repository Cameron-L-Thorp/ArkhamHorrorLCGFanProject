# ArkhamHorrorLCGFanProject

This is a personal project to integrate the rulest from Arham Horror LCG from Fantasy Flight into a programming project.
I will be homebrewing some cards and a story to create something unique, but familiar with this awesome gameset.
Idealy, I will be leveraging what I learned from the SavageWorldsCreatureHelper and use Entity Framework, starting with a UWP instead of pushing the limits of a console application, then having to convert it into a UI at a later time.
Currently, I am working to flush out the flow and story so I can have a solid plan prior to jumping into the code.
