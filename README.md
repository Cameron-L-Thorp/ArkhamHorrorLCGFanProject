# ArkhamHorrorLCGFanProject

This is a personal project to integrate the rulest from Arham Horror LCG from Fantasy Flight into a programming project.
I will be homebrewing some cards and a story to create something unique, but familiar with this awesome gameset.
Idealy, I will be leveraging what I learned from the SavageWorldsCreatureHelper and use Entity Framework, starting with a UWP instead of pushing the limits of a console application, then having to convert it into a UI at a later time.
Currently, I am working to flush out the flow and story so I can have a solid plan prior to jumping into the code.

The project is devided into two primary portions, the WinUI 3 UI, and the EF with services and CRUD colocated in the same project as the classes, acting as models for the EF. Currently, the DB is able to communicate through the use of libraries to the UI and the next challenge is tackling the construction of a multi-frame navigation within the WinUI 3 app.
